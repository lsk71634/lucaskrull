<h4>About Me</h4>
	
	<p>Hello, my name is Lucas and I grew up in a suburbs of Marietta, Ga called East Cobb. I was not always a Georgia boy. I was born in Tampa, Florida and where I lived until I was 7. I was raised on everything associated with the University of Florida. I was a die-hard Gator fan until I transferred to <abbr title="University of Georgia">UGA</abbr> where I fell in love with everything <abbr title="University of Georgia">UGA</abbr>.</p>  
	<p>Growing up in East Cobb I loved playing sports I had tried every sport by the time I was in middle school except for football. My best friend's dad was a football coach and he talked my mom into letting me play. I started playing the fall of 6th grade and developed a huge passion for football. That passion has turned into a career path that I wish to pursue after college. I retired from being a football player after playing for a decade straight but I plan on coaching the rest of my life.</p>
	<p>Besides playing football I also played the game of Rugby in high school where my team and I won a state championship. I love the country and there is no other place I rather be than at the lake during the summer. Where I can jet ski and wakeboard. During the winter I enjoy going snowboarding every few years with my family. Lastly one of my other hobbies are cars. I love trucks and exotics cars but for me nothing beats an American muscle car with a big V8 engine.</p>
